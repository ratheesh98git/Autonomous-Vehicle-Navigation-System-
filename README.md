# Autonomous-Vehicle-Navigation-System-
Welcome to the Autonomous Vehicle Navigation System repository! This project leverages computer vision and reinforcement learning techniques to enable safe and efficient self-driving capabilities. 🛤️🔍

Features 🌟
Lane Detection 🛣️:

Uses computer vision to detect lane markings on the road.
Object Detection 🚧:

Identifies and classifies objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs.
Path Planning 🗺️:

Plans an optimal path based on detected lanes and objects.
Reinforcement Learning Navigation 🧠:

Uses reinforcement learning to improve driving policies through trial and error.
